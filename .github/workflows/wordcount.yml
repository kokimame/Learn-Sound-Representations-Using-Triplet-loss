# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    env:
      MAINTITLE: MasterThesis
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
    - name: Install pdftotext
      run: | 
        sudo apt-get install build-essential libpoppler-cpp-dev pkg-config python3-dev
        sudo apt-get install pdftotext
    - name: Check if the main PDF is attached to the push
      run: |
